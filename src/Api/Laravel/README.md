## Laravel Facade

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/laravel-5|6|7|8-darkred)

The files here provide an Asana API facade to Laravel.

`hfw/asana` does not require Laravel; the facade is here as a convenience if you happen to use Laravel.

---

#### Installation

```
composer require hfw/asana
php artisan vendor:publish
```

See [config/asana.php](config/asana.php) for options.
